# AMR Simulation Project

Welcome to the AMR Simulation Project! This project aims to simulate Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in a warehouse environment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a realistic simulation of multiple AMRs operating within a warehouse. The simulation will help in understanding the behavior, efficiency, and potential issues that may arise when deploying AMRs in a real-world scenario.

## Features

- Simulate multiple AMRs navigating a warehouse
- Collision detection and avoidance
- Task assignment and scheduling
- Performance metrics and analysis

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amr-simulation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd amr-simulation
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the simulation:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
